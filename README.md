# 🦺 MineGuard — AI-Based Multi-Hazard Underground Mining Safety System

> **Tagline:** *Sense. Connect. Protect.*  
> **Initiative:** Smart India Hackathon (SIH) — SIH 206  
> **Tech Stack:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, Recharts

## 🌟 Overview

**MineGuard** is an advanced AI-powered underground mine safety and telemetry monitoring platform. Integrating smart safety jackets, multi-gas optical sensor arrays (NDIR H2S, CH4, CO), sub-surface environmental telemetry, and sub-meter UWB mesh positioning, MineGuard safeguards miners in real time.

The dashboard UI is inspired by modern light-mode web designs (such as Unstop.com), providing an intuitive, distraction-free interface for mine controllers, ground supervisors, and rapid rescue squads.

## 🎨 Design System & Aesthetic Principles

- **Color Palette:**
  - **Canvas Background:** `#EEF3FA` (Soft cool-grey page background)
  - **Floating Content Panel:** Pure white (`#FFFFFF`) with `rounded-[24px]` radius, subtle border (`#E3EAF5`), and delicate elevation
  - **Primary Blue:** `#0284C7` (Sky 600)
  - **Accent Blue:** `#0EA5E9` (Sky 500)
  - **Soft Blue Tint:** `#E0F2FE` (Sky 100)
  - **Border Gray:** `#E3EAF5`
  - **Heading Text:** `#0F172A` (Slate 900)
  - **Muted Text:** `#475569` (Slate 600)
  - **Status Fix:** Safe (`#22C55E`), Warning (`#F59E0B`), Danger (`#EF4444`)
- **Typography:**
  - **Primary Sans:** `Inter` (Google Fonts) for clean, readable headings & body text
  - **Monospace:** `JetBrains Mono` for sensor model IDs, jacket codes, telemetry figures, and timestamps
- **Component Primitives:**
  - **Headings:** Large and bold, highlighting a key action word in primary blue (`#0284C7`)
  - **Section Headers:** Vertical thin blue indicator line (`w-1.5 h-6 bg-[#0284C7] rounded-full`) on the left, with an outline pill "View All" button on the right
  - **Pastel Category Tiles:** `rounded-[20px]` soft pastel cards (Light Blue, Peach, Yellow, Green, Lavender) displaying core metrics
  - **Pill Buttons:** `rounded-full` primary sky blue and secondary outline variants
  - **Initials Avatars:** Pure initials avatar without photos (e.g., "RK", "VS"), `#E0F2FE` background, `#0284C7` bold text, with optional status ring (green/amber/red)

## 👥 Role Switcher

Using the **"You're viewing as"** selector in the sidebar, users can toggle between three operational roles:
1. **Supervisor** — Central Command, safety oversight, sensor calibrations
2. **Worker** — Smart jacket telemetry HUD, self biometrics, and personal hazard alerts
3. **Rescue Team** — Emergency dispatch, sub-surface extraction, and rapid response units
